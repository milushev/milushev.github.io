title: About me
subtitle: Dimiter in a nutshell.
---

<p> As a professional holding a PhD in Information Security and a Master in Business Administration, I have
always been excited by the possibility of applying technological and scientific advancements to solve complex business problems. At the moment, I am really interested in the <i>application of data science for the purposes of cyber-security</i>, namely
identifying risk and improving the overall information security level at the modern organization. 
Besides, I am constantly searching for other new challenges in the fields of data science, machine learning and cyber-security.</p> 

<p>
For almost seven years I have worked on a range of topics, spanning the spectrum from formal verification of security policies, through machine learning for security, to analysis of bioinformatics data. 
Needless to say, I am very much excited by these fields and plan to continue my work there.

In my free-time I like playing with my daughter Karoline, playing the guitar, as well-as spending time in nature: fly-fishing, hiking or photographing. </p>
