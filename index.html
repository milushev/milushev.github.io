title: About me
subtitle: Dimiter in a nutshell.
---

I am constantly searching for new opportunities in the fields of data science/machine learning and computer security. As a seasoned researcher with a PhD in Computer Science, I am naturally interested in novel scientific and technological advancements and in their potential to solve complex problems from other domains. The symbiosis between unprecedented computing power (GPU computing), powerful algorithms, big data and interesting, high-impact problems makes the data science/machine learning field extremely appealing for an ambitious researcher like me. For almost seven years I have worked on a range of topics, spanning the spectrum from formal verification of security policies to analysis of bioinformatics data. 
I hold a *PhD in Computer Science* from <a href="https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/english">KU Leuven</a>, Belgium an *MBA in technology Management* from the <a href="http://www.nithh.de">NIT</a>,
and *MSc in Information and Media Technology* from the <a href="http://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite.html">Hamburg Univeristy of Technology</a>, Germany and a *BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics* from 
<a href="www.linfield.edu/">Linfield College</a>, USA. 
In my free-time I like playing with my daughter, playing guitar, as well-as spending time in nature: fly-fishing, hiking or photographing.
